1.My program will generate the random key first,the key image have some patterns, every 4 pixels have 2 random black pixels.after that ,the program will use the key to encrypt the sercet image which is providey by the professor.then I use the key to restore the original image which is the decrption process


2.The program does not take the key file as run, just generate it by itself.so the program have some limitation for the testing.however it works well for the generated key file.
